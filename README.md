# Overview
This was a project that was completed for school work years ago.

This project utilises a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to create a functioning robot car. The robot comprises of two DC motors which are controlled using a L298n motor drive board.

The robot car itself is controlled through a simple web app accessible via a mobile or desktop. User data such as name, start time of drive and end time of drive are captured and stored in a csv file, which is then uploaded into Google’s app engine storage.

# Further Development
Due to the $150 budget, there are many things that unfortunately could not be incorporated into the robot car. These include components such as sensors and cameras. By implementing sensors into the robot car, it can operate automatically without a driver, much like AGVs (Automatic Guided Vehicles). Incorporating a camera into the robot creates new purposes for it. With both a camera and sensors, it can become an AGV that circles your home while recording and live streaming footage, acting as a security bot. Using the same method that is being used with the current model of the robot, the footage/images that the camera captures can then be uploaded to Google’s app engine storage, where it will be untouchable if intruders were to enter your home. With the many components available for the raspberry pi, the potential expansions to this robot seem endless.
